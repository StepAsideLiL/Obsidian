[Hegelianism - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegelianism)
**Hegelianism** is the philosophy of [G. W. F. Hegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel "Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel") in which reality has a conceptual structure. Pure Concepts are not subjectively applied to sense-impressions but rather things exist for actualizing their [_a priori_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori "A priori and a posteriori") pure concept. The concept of the concept is called the Idea by Hegel.
