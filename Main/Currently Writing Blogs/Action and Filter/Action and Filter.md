# WordPress Hooks
WordPress Hooks are a way for one piece of code to interact or modify another piece of code at specific, pre-defined spots. They allow developers to change or extend functionality of WordPress without needing to edit the WordPress core code itself. They make up the foundation for how plugins and themes interact with WordPress Core, but theyâ€™re also used extensively by Core itself.
