# What is WordPress?
WordPress is open-source software you can use to create a beautiful website, blog, or app. It is a content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL. It is the most popular and widely used CMS software in the world. As of March 2022, WordPress powers over 43% of websites worldwide.

WordPress was released on May 27, 2003, by its founders, [Matt Mullenweg](https://twitter.com/photomatt) and [Mike Little](https://twitter.com/mikelittlezed1). WordPress began as a fork of b2/cafelog which was developed in early 2001 by a French programmer [Michel Valdrighi](https://twitter.com/kalaphates). The idea of creating pages dynamically from MySQL database contents was originated from b2/cafelog.

Even though WordPress started as a simple blogging platform initially, it has evolved into a powerful CMS. From a simple blog to multi-vendor e-commerce WordPress now can be customized into anything without writing any code. There are plugins for every possible feature a website needs.

# Why WordPress is so popular?
There are many reasons for its popularity. Here are some most important ones-

### 1. Free and Open-source
The biggest reason is that WordPress is free. You can download it and use it without any cost. It is also open-source. Meaning that the source code is open to see, modify and share.

### 2. Easy to use.
WordPress is easy to use. Anyone can set up a WordPress site very easily in no time. And there is no need for coding knowledge to build a beautiful website with WordPress.

### 3. SEO friendly.
WordPress sites are known to rank higher than other sites in search engines. WordPress out of the box has metadata included on every page. Metadata provides search engines with important information about the content and purpose of each page on the website. It also helps them determine whether the website is relevant enough to display in search results.

### 4. Very customizable.
WordPress is very customizable. Themes and plugins give freedom to design anything type of site in WordPress. But the developer also can write themes and plugins to meet their expectation. That's why WordPress is a very diverse community of developers and designers.

### 5. Plugin for everything.
WordPress has plugins for any type of work. Plugins extend the functionality of WordPress beyond imagination. Plugins convert WordPress from a simple blogging site to online store, learning management system(LMS), forum, and so on.

# How WordPress works
To set up your WordPress website, you need a few things:

### Domain
A domain is the name of your website. It is what a user types in the browser URL bar to visit your website. Every website needs a domain name. Without a domain, a user can't access any site. Your domain name will be configured in a way so that it can point users to your hosting service. It is the address of your website.

### Hosting Service
A hosting service is a server that hosts your website. Hosting is the process of allocating disk space in a server so that you can upload your WordPress files. All website needs to be hosted on a server so that any user can see the content of the website. Hosting is the house of your WordPress site.

### Database
Database stores all the content of your WordPress site. WordPress uses MySQL for its database management system(DBMS). In general, all hosting service comes with a MySQL database.

# WordPress Admin Dashboard
WordPress Admin Dashboard, also known as WP Admin, is where you manage everything on your site. You can change the active theme, install plugins, manage your posts and content, create new pages, upload media, add new users, and more. A plugin can add its settings to WP admin. Here is what a fresh installation of WordPress looks like.
